# Objective: to write a frontend, single page app using only vanilla JavaScript

This is an exercise in object oriented javaScript following the design principles of TDD, DRY, and single responsibility.

I used this as exercise as an opportunity to learn how to manipulate the DOM with vanilla javaScript.

The app allows you to record notes and display them by clicking on a link. The link consists of the first 20 characters of the note.

To run, install http-server using npm (node package manager) using this command:

```
npm install http-server -g
```

To run the server, navigate to the project folder and run the server using this command:

```
http-server
```

The page can then be viewed in your browser by navigating to this address:

[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
