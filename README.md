# Objective: to write a frontend, single page app using only pure JavaScript

This is an exercise in well written object oriented javaScript following the design principles of TDD, DRY, and single responsibility.

The app allows you to record notes and display them by clicking on a link. The link consists of the first 20 characters of the note.

To run, install http-server using npm (node package manager) using this command:

```
npm install http-server -g
```

To run the server, navigate to the project folder and run the server using this command:

```
http-server
```

The page can then be viewed in your browser by navigating to this address:

[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
