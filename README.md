# Writing a frontend, single page app using only pure JavaScript (further JS)

## Learning objectives

### Concepts

* Frontend, [single page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/dn463786.aspx) web apps.
* Events and event handlers.
* Manipulating the [Document Object Model (DOM)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction).
* Ajax.
* Frontend templating.
* Frontend routing.


This is an exercise in using vanilla javaScript without any libraries to produce a single page web app.

The aim is to fully DRY the code and SRP each function.

The aim is for the code to speak for itself, not requiring any comments.
